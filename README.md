# Numbers N' Units!
CS 252 Lab 6 Node.js Application

# Project Description
This is a web application that will allow users to convert units across the metric system and imperial system. For example, converting from celsius to fahrenheit, inches to meters, liters to gallons, etc.
It is also capable of taking any number as input, parsing it, and displaying a wide variety of information related to that number, such as its square root, its factors, whether it's prime or composite, and more.

# Technologies and Services
I will use Heroku to host this application. The technology I use is Node.js for server-side code, while I use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the front-end. I plan to use Firebase in order to implement a database for the application.
